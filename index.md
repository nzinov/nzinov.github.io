I received my master's degree in Computer/Data Science at Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology and work as ML team lead at Yandex, where I mainly work on very deep neural networks for NLP and open domain module of Alice voice assistant.

In my spare time I like to listen to and perform classical and popular music (I play violin). I also like reading, mountain hiking and DIY.
